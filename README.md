# UniboCalendar
This python script generates a `.ics` file of a UniBo course's timetable.

## Why
I wanted my classes' schedule in my personal calendar in order to better plan my days.

## Setup
I recommend to use python venv.
1. Install requirements with pip
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your envirorment variables
3. Run `main.py`
